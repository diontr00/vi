"This project draws inspiration from **gorilla/mux**, and I appreciate the ease of working with the library. However, its performance falls short of my expectations. After conducting research, my goal is to develop a high-performance HTTP router that not only outperforms but also retains the convenient API of mux, enhanced with additional support for regex. I welcome any feedback as this will be my first open source projects."

# Matching Rule

- **Named parameter**
  - **Syntax:** :name
  - **Example:** /student/:name
  - **Explain:** Match name as word

* **Name with regex pattern**
  - **Syntax:** {name:regex-pattern}
  - **Example:** /student/{id:[0-9]+}
  * **Explain:** Match id as number

- **Helper pattern**
  - **:id** : short for **/student/{id:[0-9]+}**
  - **:name** : short for **/{name:[0-9a-zA-Z]+}**
